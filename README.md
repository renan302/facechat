# facechat
>Relationship Chat Open Source
>This is an open source chat, developed using the latest cutting edge technologies on the market. We designed this project to use three micro services: > >ChatService, UserService and FileService.
>
>ChatService: This service was developed using Node.js with mongodb and is used to mediate conversations between users through socket.io.
>
>UserService: This service was developed using .NET Core with MySQL and is used as CRUD for basic user registration.
>
>FileService: This service was developed using .NET Core and is responsible for storing and providing files, such as images for the application. We chose it as a >service, because we want to have the flexibility to stay where it will be financially viable.
